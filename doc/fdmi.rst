======================
FDMI in Multisite work
======================

The purpose of this document is to provide a list of FDMI features that are
needed for multisite work, along with current status of these features. The
list would be used a reference to design and implement missing features.


Introduction
============

`FDMI <https://github.com/Seagate/cortx-motr/blob/main/fdmi/fdmi.c#L48>`_
subsystem in `Motr <https://github.com/Seagate/cortx-motr>`_ is going to be
used to get a list of S3 objects that need to be replicated to other sites.

To get a list of Motr tasks for FDMI subsystem to implement missing features we
started with a simple `FDMI-based PoC
<https://github.com/Seagate/cortx/milestone/1>`_  which does the following:
when S3 PUT operation is done there is an FDMI plugin that captures metadata
about this object and prints it to stdout.


Definitions
===========

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in `RFC 2119 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119>`_.


Requirements
============

TODO assign stable IDs

.. list-table::
    :widths: 5 30 30 5 30
    :header-rows: 1

    * - ID
      - Description
      - Comment
      - Done?
      - How and what else is needed?
    * - TBD
      - It MUST be possible to get DIX PUT kv pairs in a Motr process which
        doesn't have CAS service that received CAS PUT request for the DIX PUT
        request.
      - It's needed to be able to get kv pairs from all CASes in a single Motr
        process.
      - N
      - FDMI record is supposed to contains CAS kv pairs, and there is an
        implementation for FDMI record sending/receiving. There is a bug in
        implementation though: kv pairs are being freed too early in CAS, and
        they are not beint sent nor logged to BE log as FOL records. Fix for
        this issue: `cortx-motr/pull/588
        <https://github.com/Seagate/cortx-motr/pull/588>`_.
    * - TBD
      - It MUST be possible to get CAS kv pair even if CAS was not running at
        the time DIX PUT execution was initiated.
      - This is needed to handle transient process failures (crash/restart
        etc.) from DTX PUT point of view.
      - N
      - DTM0 is required for this. Some integration work may or may not be
        required. It will not be known before DTM0 is landed.
    * - TBD
      - It MUST be possible to get CAS kv pair even if a Motr process with the
        CAS inside crashes during DIX PUT execution: after CAS PUT is executed,
        but before FDMI record receival is acknowledged by FDMI plugin on FDMI
        source.
      - This is needed to handle transient process failures (crash/restart)
        from CAS PUT point of view.
      - N
      - It requires sending FDMI records sometime around or after BE
        recovery.
    * - TBD
      - It MUST be possible to determine when FDMI records are never going to
        be resent from FDMI source.
      - It's needed to provide a way for FDMI plugin to prune records
        that are never going to be received.
      - N
      - We need to do the following:

        - send FDMI record BE log position (approximate is enough) with each
          FDMI record;
        - send BE log position of discarded records that are never going to be
          replayed again during BE recovery.

        Each CAS would provide such position, and it would be possible to do
        per- storage device pruning.
    * - TBD
      - It MUST be possible to adjust FDMI filters in runtime.
      - This is needed to adjust replication configuration (what to replicate,
        where to replicate to etc.) in runtime.
      - N
      - We need to do the following:

        - store FDMI filters configuration in a distributed index
        - read FDMI filter configuration from a distributed index during FDMI
          startup
        - add a way to update filter configuration in runtime
        - add a tool to adjust filter configuration in runtime

        Currently we have filters in Motr configuration. Each filter supports
        only one endpoint where to send FDMI records to (this may not enough
        for multisite). Currently there is no code in Motr/Hare to add filters
        to the configuration or to change the filter configuration.
    * - TBD
      - It MUST be possible to adjust FDMI filter targets in runtime.
      - This is needed to configure or reconfigure sets of Schedulers after
        initial cluster bootstrap.
      - N
      - We need to do the same as for the previous requirement.
    * - TBD
      - It MUST be possible to determine the outcome of a DIX PUT operation if
        multiple DIX PUT operations were executed for the same key in the same
        distributed index.
      - This is needed to handle sequential and, if required, concurrent object
        metadata updates for the same object.
      - N
      - DTM0 design is required to figure out how to do this and DTM0 landing
        is required to implement this.
